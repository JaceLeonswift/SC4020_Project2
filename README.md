Next Location Prediction
- Geospatial Data Science Project 
- Developed a context-aware neural network that can predict a userâ€™s next location with top-5 accuracy >95%, which is higher than current reported literature, by mining staypoints & locations from Global
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Places-of-Interest (POI) data collected from Japan
- Integrated state-of-the-art MHSA transformer architecture with LDA, sinusoidal position encoding & ADAM optimiser to produce efficient model
